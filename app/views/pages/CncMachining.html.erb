  <div class="prototypes">
    <p>Boman Technologies specializes in CNC prototype machined parts for small volume jobs, working hand-in-hand with our clients to match exact customer-specified dimensions, critical functional areas and overall design intent.<p>

    <p>Some of our clients need simply one production quality prototype part for proof of concept, visual testing or form fit and function while others need multiple parts for engineering testing or marketing studies. Regardless of your job volume, in most instances we are able to provide production quality parts in the same materials that the final product will be made from in a production environment.</p>

    <p>We can machine any off-the-shelf material and we also have the ability to injection mold blanks to machine from in other exotic materials that are not sold in sheet or rod stock. Providing our clients with CNC prototypes made in the final material that the product will be manufactured from allows them to perform all internal testing accurately prior to product approval.</p>
